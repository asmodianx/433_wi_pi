Notes on working with systemd in respbian:

Enable services:
        systemctl enable rtl_433
        systemctl enable kismet
        systemctl enable chrony
        systemctl enable gpsd
        
reload services after .system file has been changed
        systemctl daemon-reload

reprocess changes to system files
         systemctl daemon-reexec
